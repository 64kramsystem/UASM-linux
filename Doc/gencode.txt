  1. What is generated code

  Some directives (and also instructions RET/IRET inside a procedure block)
  will generate source lines. In the listing file, those generated
  lines will be marked with a '*'.

  2. Where is generated code used?

  - INVOKE directive
  - hll directives (.IF, .ELSE, .WHILE, .REPEAT, ...)
  - .MODEL directive
  - .STARTUP and .EXIT directives
  - simplified segment directives (.CODE, .DATA, .CONST, ...)
  - default PROC prologue and epilogue (when a RET/IRET is detected)
  - ENDP ( in Win64, if procedure has FRAME attribute )
  - END 
    + if a segment opened by simplified segment directives is still open
    + PE format: generates import/export data, MZ header
  - [removed since v2.09: STRUCT data initialization (was slightly peculiar)]
